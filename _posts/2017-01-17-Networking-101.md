<p><strong>Networking 101:</strong> Breaking the First Barriers is a free event that will feature a panel discussion during which you will hear highly experienced professionals discussing their own tips and secrets on making those useful connections that can alter the course of your career. This is the first of a two part series and will focus primarily on the initial meeting and interaction. The event continues afterwards with a Networking Session and Libations, during which you can put your skills to the practice and make some meaningful connections. This event will be of particular interest to early career professionals and trainees, but will still be relevant to even the most senior professionals.</p>
