<p><strong>Networking 101:</strong> Breaking the First Barriers is a free event that will feature a panel discussion during which you will hear highly experienced professionals discussing their own tips and secrets on making those useful connections that can alter the course of your career. This is the first of a two part series and will focus primarily on the initial meeting and interaction. The event continues afterwards with a Networking Session and Libations, during which you can put your skills to the practice and make some meaningful connections. This event will be of particular interest to early career professionals and trainees, but will still be relevant to even the most senior professionals.</p>

<p><strong>About the event: </strong></p>
The panel is comprised of 3 local professionals who are well versed in networking and will briefly share their story and some key tips. The bulk of the panel discussion will be an open Q&amp;A session.

<p>The 2nd Annual CHIentist: Connections Matter event was a huge success! On June 16th this signature event brought together 150+ members of the local Life Sciences community to meet and network with other like-minded individuals from dozens of businesses and institutes across the greater Chicago area. Thanks again to our Sponsors for helping make this event possible.</p>

<p>Our annual Connections Matter event provides a unique networking opportunity and will bring together researchers, entrepreneurs and industry professionals in order to create connections between these often segmented communities. The goals of this event are to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Provide an accessible platform for local researchers and professionals to network</li>
<li>Foster cross-talk between professional niches</li>
<li>Encourage communication between various sectors of the life sciences ecosystem</li>
</ol>
<br />
<p>The agenda for our Connections Matter event typically includes both structured ('speed') and freestyle networking, in addition to a few short talks by prominent members of the Chicago Life Sciences Community.</p>
