<p>The 2nd Annual CHIentist: Connections Matter event was a huge success! On June 16th this signature event brought together 150+ members of the local Life Sciences community to meet and network with other like-minded individuals from dozens of businesses and institutes across the greater Chicago area. Thanks again to our Sponsors for helping make this event possible.</p>

<p>Our annual Connections Matter event provides a unique networking opportunity and will bring together researchers, entrepreneurs and industry professionals in order to create connections between these often segmented communities. The goals of this event are to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Provide an accessible platform for local researchers and professionals to network</li>
<li>Foster cross-talk between professional niches</li>
<li>Encourage communication between various sectors of the life sciences ecosystem</li>
</ol>
<br />
<p>The agenda for our Connections Matter event typically includes both structured ('speed') and freestyle networking, in addition to a few short talks by prominent members of the Chicago Life Sciences Community.</p>
