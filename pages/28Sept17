About the Icla da Silva Foundation:
 
The Icla da Silva Foundation is the largest recruitment center for the Be the Match Registry in the United States. We recruit over 38,000 new potential bone marrow donors every year, with a strong focus on ethnically diverse communities. The Icla da Silva Foundation was established in 1992, in memory of a 13-year old Brazilian girl named Icla da Silva. 25 year later, her brother Airam is the foundation's President, and we havet representatives across the US and Puerto Rico with the mission of saving lives by recruiting bone marrow donors and providing support services to children and adults with leukemia and other diseases treatable by marrow transplants. As patients with ethnically diverse backgrounds face a greater challenge in finding a donor, we work closely with the Hispanic, African American, Asian and Native American communities to raise awareness about the need for a more diverse registry. 70% of patients do not have a fully matched donor in the family, so more people are needed to join the registry to help patients find matches and to save lives!
