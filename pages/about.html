<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">CHIentist is a grassroots initiative that seeks to create
  a sense of community and build new connections among life scientists and professionals
  in the Chicago area by encouraging networking on a regular basis. Our organization provides
  a platform for in-person and virtual communication, exchanges of ideas and opportunities,
  and the maintenance of interpersonal bonds that support future career endeavors.
  <br /><br />
  CHIentist helps to bridge the gap between long separated groups under a common
  interest in science and a desire for a collaborative and nurturing community in Chicago.</p>
