CHIentist brings together members of Chicago’s life sciences ecosystem to facilitate interactions, encourage collaborations, and foster the development of ideas, careers, and business ventures. By hosting recurrent networking events, our organization acts as a platform to unite disparate scientific sectors and create lasting connections that will bolster Chicago’s standing as a major biomedical hub for science and innovation.
Our goals as an organization are:

* 1. To serve as a liaison among members of all sectors of the Chicago life science community
* 2. To host informal networking events, facilitating the creation of new connections and potential collaborations
* 3. To host a yearly signature event, bringing together key leaders from entrepreneurship, biotechnology, pharma, academia, business, law, consulting, and related fields in a setting that further augments the cohesiveness of these groups and allows for the free flow of information and ideas, promoting innovation and career development.
